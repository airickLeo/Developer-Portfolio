# Learnings
- add margin to sections to avoid issue of wrong section detection
- Use of tailwindcss and how to dynamically render
the portfolio based on device size
- The use of z-index, relative and absolute, and
how absolute can shift a particular section down
to avoid overlaying issue (i.e hero is under the navbar, since
navbar has higher z index)
- h-screen to create a hero
- highlighting navbar links on page scroll

Need to debug:
- for contact section, add linkedin and github to the side of the form
- tech section is overlaying experience section
- fix experience card (add dates and info)
- highlighting nav upon scroll to position
- fix hero section to make it look better on mobile
